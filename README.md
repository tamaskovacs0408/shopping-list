<h1>Shopping list</h1>

<p>With this responsive React app you can add, update and delete elements to/from your shopping list. With the edit icon you can edit/update your element, and with the red X you can delete it. The 'Clear list' button deletes all elements from the list.</p>
<p>After every interaction a notification bar appears on the top of the application. The animations are from the <a href='https://animate.style/'>Animate CSS</a> package.</p>
<p>There is a setting on the application with the browser's local storage, that if you have items on your list and when you reload the page the items will remain on the list.</p>
